This is pia-forward, a simple script for setting up port forwarding with the
[Private Internet Access VPN service] [1]. To install run
`cabal install pia-forward` , or just `cabal install` inside of a sdist or
checkout. Run it with `pia-forward`. There are no options. You'll be prompted
for your username and password at first run. Ctrl-C when you're done.

If you have problems or pull requests, I'm using [GitHub's issue tracker] [2].
